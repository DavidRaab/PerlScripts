# Info

Some one-file Perl programs I have written.

## Overview

### changeIndent

Changes Indentation of files. For example 2 spaces to 4 spaces, and any other combination.

### mkperlsk

Helper file to create Perl scripts with usually header and execute bit on.

### mounted

"mount" command in Linux shows to many virtual filesystems. This helper
just shows real harddisks and formats the output in a table.

### yt-music

More user-friendly helper over yt-dlp to download music from YouTube. Downloads mp3
or ogg depending on file extensions user has choosen.

### splitaudio

You have one big audio file and want to split it into a chunks of audio file with titles?
This one does the job with ffmpeg, in parallel.

### prefix

When you have many files and you want to put a number before them to order all files.
Then you can use this scripts. It interactively asks you for the number and every file.

### prefix.fsx

Converted Perl `prefix` to F#. This is just for learning-purpose. F# scripts
usually starts to slow for fast running scripts.

### sync-player

A synchronization script I use to sync my music player with my music library
on my PC.
